# # Time dependent parameters example
#
# In this example, we are going to have a look at how to 
# a Penning trap.
#
# You will learn how to:
#  * Set up a simple simulation with one ion in an ideal Penning trap
#  * Store simulation data (in this case the position of the ion) to memory
#  * Access the simulation data
#  * Plot the simulated ion motion

Uâ‚€ = ConstantParameter(-50.0) + LinearDriftParameter(3e6)
câ‚‚ = ConstantParameter(-14960.0)
Bâ‚€ = ConstantParameter(1.0)

# ## Instantiate trap
#
# The [`Trap`](@ref) object contains all things related to a single Penning trap.
# In this example, we are using an [`IdealTrapField`](@ref) with the previously 
# specified parameters.
# For more complex simulations, this is the place where you would also add 
# for example excitation fields or field imperfections.
#
# Since an empty trap would be quite boring, we have to specify the particle species and 
# initial positions and velocities of all particles contained in the simulation.
# `Penning.jl` groups particles of same particle species into [`ParticleCollection`](@ref)s, which
# is a concept that becomes important if you want to specify and control inter-particle interactions.
# But since we only want to simulate a single ion we only need a single particle collection.
# In this example, we are using an ion with mass 187 u (atomic mass unit) and charge state
# 30 (in elementary charge unit).
# The initial position and velocity have to be specified in meters and meters per second.

trap = Trap(
    fields = (
        IdealTrapField(Uâ‚€, câ‚‚, Bâ‚€),
    ),
    particles = (
        ParticleCollection(Ion(187, 30), [[0, 0, 50e-6]], [[1000, 0, 0]]),
    )
)

# ## Instantiate setup
#
# The following code instantiates a [`Setup`](@ref) object, which contains all
# "subsystems" that should be included in this simulation setup.
# In this example, we only want to simulate our previously instantiated trap, 
# but in more complex simulations this would be the place where you would for example
# add multiple traps, add electrical circuits and specify their connections.

setup = Setup(
    traps = (
        trap,
    )
)

# ## Instantiate simulation object
# 
# The [`Simulation`](@ref) object contains a single reference to a [`Setup`](@ref)
# object and is otherwise responsible for  storing information about how the simulation
# is performed. Here, we specify that we want to use a time step (`dt`) of 20 ns and 
# specify which data we want to save during simulation.
# In `Penning.jl`, data is stored using "output writers", which offers various "data storage backends".
# In this case we are using a [`MemoryWriter`](@ref), which stores data into
# system memory (RAM).
#
# The code `PositionObservable(1, 1, 1)` tells our MemoryWriter that we want to store
# the position of the particle in trap `1`, particle collection `1` and index `1`.
# (Note that the first index in Julia is 1, not 0)
#
# The code `IterationInterval(1)` specifies the times at which the specified observable
# is to be saved. In this case, we want to store data at every simulation iteration.

sim = Simulation(
    setup,
    dt=dt,
    output_writers=(
        MemoryWriter(PositionObservable(1, 1, 1), IterationInterval(1)),
    )
)

# ## Run simulation
#
# Its finally time to run the simulation!
# Just specify how long you want to simulate and lean back (but not for too long - `Penning.jl` is fast ðŸ˜‰).
# Take a look at the documentation of [`run!`](@ref) for further stop conditions.

run!(sim, run_until_time=10e-6)

# ## Retreive simulation data
#
# Data stored inside a [`MemoryWriter`](@ref) can be accessed in the following way:

r = sim.output_writers[1].mem
t = sim.output_writers[1].t

x = getindex.(r, 1)
y = getindex.(r, 2)
z = getindex.(r, 3)

plot(t, z)
