# Getting started

This section covers the basics of installing Julia and Penning.jl, and then describes best practices when running
setting up your environment. If you're new to Julia, we also recommend reading [Julia's "getting started" page](https://julialang.org/learning/getting-started/).


## Installation instructions

Usually the hardest part of installing Penning.jl is installing Julia. You can first check if your
system already has Julia installed. If that's not the case, installation is necessary and you can
[download](https://julialang.org/downloads/) Julia from its official website, where also you can
find [platform-specific installation instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/).
Alternatively, you can also manually [compile Julia from source code](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia#building-julia).
